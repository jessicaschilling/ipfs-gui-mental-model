# IPFS GUI family mental model

This IPFS GUI family mental model offers a framework for understanding how IPFS’ various GUI-based tools work together to provide cohesive, consistent enablers to using and building on IPFS for a variety of developer and non-developer stakeholder groups. 

It was bootstrapped from [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and relies heavily upon [https://tachyons.io/](tachyons) and [https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-css](ipfs-css).

For more details surrounding this project, please view the ["About" guide in the mental model itself](https://ipfs-gui-mental-model.netlify.app/about), or see the [IPFS GUI Working Group](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-gui) repo for broader context.
